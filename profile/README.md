Credibil provides a framework — a collection of libraries — for use in the
development of antifragile, hyper-distributed applications.

## Building Blocks

We support the building of distributed apps on top of open standards-based 
technologies:

- **Decentralized Identifiers** ([DIDs](https://github.com/credibil/did)) — 
tamper-proof, self-owned identifiers similar to email addresses or usernames

- **Verifiable Credentials** ([VCs](https://github.com/credibil/vc)) — secure 
digital certificates that provide cryptograpically verifiable proof of things
like name, age and asset ownership

- **Decentralized Web Nodes** ([DWNs](https://github.com/credibil/dwn)) — 
distributed data storage nodes with replicated state deployed in mesh-like 
construct 

## Implementation

All libraries are written in Rust and designed to be used in a variety of 
environments, including WebAssembly, mobile, and server-side applications.

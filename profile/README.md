Credibil comprises a collection of libraries intended to underpin the development
of decentralized applications.

## Core Building Blocks

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

DIDs are self-generated and self-owned identifiers that enable identity 
authentication in a decentralized world. A DID is akin to an email address or
username, without being owned or controlled by a company or stored on a
centralized server. They cannot be deleted or altered by anyone except for
the entity that owns them.

### Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

Verified Credentials (VCs) are digital credentials taht can be easily shared in
a privacy-respecting and secure manner. They can be used to represent physical
credentials, such as a passport or license, or indeed any other type of 
information, but in a more tamper-resistant, digital format.

### Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs/DWeb Nodes)

DWeb Nodes represent an emerging standard for decentralized storage of app
and personal data. They enable developers to build decentralized apps and 
protocols where entities own and control their data.

## Implementation

The libraries are written in Rust and are designed to be used in a variety of environments, including WebAssembly, mobile, and server-side applications.

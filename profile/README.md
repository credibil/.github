Credibil provides a framework — a collection of libraries — intended for use
in the development of anti-fragile, hyper-distributed applications.

## Building Blocks

We build distributed apps on top a collection of open standards-based
technologies:

- **Decentralized Identifiers** ([DIDs](https://github.com/credibil/did)) — 
tamper-proof, self-owned identifiers similar to email addresses or usernames

- **Verifiable Credentials** ([VCs](https://github.com/credibil/vc)) — secure 
digital certificates called that provide legal proof of things like name, age 
and ownership of assets

- **Decentralized Web Nodes** ([DWNs](https://github.com/credibil/dwn)) — nodes
that store and synchronize data in a distributed manner.

## Implementation

The libraries are written in Rust and are designed to be used in a variety of 
environments, including WebAssembly, mobile, and server-side applications.
